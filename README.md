# Palindrome Checker

This is my attempt on one of the five projects from the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certification from FreeCodeCamp.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the web page.
2. `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the palindrome checking logic and DOM manipulation.
3. `styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the web page.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a word or phrase into the input field.
2. Upon clicking the "Check Palindrome" button, the application processes the input.
3. The input is cleaned by removing non-alphanumeric characters and converting to lowercase.
4. The cleaned input is then checked to see if it reads the same forwards and backwards.
5. The result is displayed on the page, with different colors indicating whether the input is a palindrome or not.
